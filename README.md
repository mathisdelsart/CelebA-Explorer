# LDATA2010 - Information Visualization 📊

Welcome to the repository for the course **LDATA2010 - Information Visualization** for the academic year **2024-2025**

This course dives into the fundamentals of data visualization, blending theory with hands-on practice. Here, you'll find lab exercises (TPs) and the project developed during the year. While most TPs are incomplete, they still offer valuable insights into key visualization techniques.

## Repository Content 📂

### 1. **Lab Exercises (TPs)**  
The TPs are designed to help you practice and apply the concepts taught in class. While some are not fully completed, they cover essential topics such as:  
- **Critiquing and Redesigning Visualizations** to improve clarity and communication.  
- **Clustering Techniques** to group similar data points based on their features.  
- **Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR)** to visualize high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional spaces.  
- **Creating Interactive Dashboards with Dash** to display and interact with data dynamically.  

📌 **Note**: If you'd like to complete or improve the TPs, your contributions are more than welcome.

### 2. **The Project**

#### **Project Theme**:
Develop an interactive data visualization app based on a real dataset. This year, we worked with the popular **CelebA dataset** to explore facial characteristics and implemented tools such as:  
- **Clustering images based on features**  
- **Similarity search between faces**  
- **Dynamic filtering and dimensionality reduction**  

This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into clear and actionable insights through visualization.
